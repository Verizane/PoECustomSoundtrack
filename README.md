# Path of Exile Custom Soundtrack

**You pick the soundtrack for every area in game**

This app watches the Path of Exile log file to detect area changes and then plays a predefined track from youtube.

The default config shipping with the app is my attempt at replacing PoE's in game music with the music from Diablo II.

I did **not** build this because I think the Path of Exile soundtrack is bad, in fact I enjoy it quite a lot.  I built it because the Diablo II soundtrack drips so heavily with nostalgia that it makes me feel like I'm back in highschool.  Combining this with the game play of Path of Exile made excited enough to start coding.

## To Use

Load up the program, use the crappy interface to choose the folder where you installed Path of Exile.  Don't worry, it doesn't write any files, it just reads the `Path of Exile/Logs/Client.txt` file to detect when your in game area changes.

Turn your in game music volume down to 0

Switch areas in game, you should be hearing Diablo II music!

## Will I get banned for using this?

I won't say yes or no, but given that this program's only interaction with Path of Exile is reading a text file from the log folder, I'd say the chances aren't very high.
